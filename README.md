Asibot TaskLib (legacy code)

From https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/asibot-main/issues/40
- Programs:
   - asibotTasks -> Sounded like a great idea, think I actually did some full trajectories like a man moving around a simulated environment and putting on some make-up, but can't think of a practical use for this. I actually recall this was when I was motivated with automated planning such as PDDL and wanted these to be atomic tasks. An idea is to migrate these demo-like behaviours to an interpreted language.
   - taskServer -> Most probably related to asibotTasks. I'd probably IMPROVE it, since it certainly isn't even a nice wrapper as in YARP devices.
